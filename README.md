# DirectShifts Assignment

Developer Note: Given the ETA(2 days) for this assessment,
I have implemented all features using Rails(API and UI) for now as I have not worked with React.

1. Users should be able to Sign-Up/Login both via UI and via API call.
2. Users should be able to send referral link to any email address.
3. The referral email should contain a link that redirects to sign up page.
4. Userâ€™s home page should show all the email addresses that were referred.
